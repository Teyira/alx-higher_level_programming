## Python - Classes and Objects
> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> classes, instances, private/public fields/attributes, methods/functions, ```__str__``` to print,
> comparator methods (```!=``` ```__ne__```, ```==``` ```__eq__```, ```>=``` ```__ge__```)

### Description of what each file shows:
* test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
* Files that start with:
0. create empty square class and build on this class in next files
1. add private attribute size
2. validate size is int and >= 0 else TypeError
3. define public method area with ValueError if size < 0
4. define getter and setter for size
5. define print method to print square with "#"'s
6. define private position attribute to use in printing offsets
100. 100 - Singly Linked List - create head, insert nodes, print with ```__str__```
101. 101 - define ```__str__``` method to print square if called with print()
102. 102 - define comparator methods
103. 103 - recreate code to match Bytecode (re: class, import, private attribute)
